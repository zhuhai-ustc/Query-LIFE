# Query-LIFE
#
## We take out crossattention and draw a heat map, where the abscissa is the image vector and the ordinate is the multi modal vector.

As shown in below Figure, in query-life's multi-modal vector of the toy product, most of the attention is focused on the image; while for the phone product, there are a few attention focused on image. On the contrary, blip2 maintains a relatively uniform attention distribution for toys and phones.
